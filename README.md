# GPTrain

Welcome to GPTrain! This is a sophisticated tool designed for job training simulations using the cutting-edge capabilities of the LLM GPT. Whether you're training for sales or any other job, GPTrain will offer a realistic experience that closely resembles a video call conversation.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Through the integration of OpenCV, the application can detect emotions from the video feed.
  
- **Voice Transcription**: Using the Whisper ASR system, the tool transcribes voice to text in real-time.
  
- **Real-time Conversation**: By utilizing the OpenAI GPT API, the application provides near-human conversation experiences.
